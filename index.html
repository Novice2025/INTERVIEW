            <p class="ceo-quote">"An interview is more than just a Q&A; it's a two-way street. It's your moment to demonstrate not just what you've done, but who you are and how you'll contribute to our future. We're looking for your unique story."</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3 class="subsection-title">Understanding the Purpose (Para Brasileiros)</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">Para você, que está se preparando para uma entrevista em inglês, é fundamental entender o verdadeiro propósito por trás dela. Não é apenas sobre testar seu inglês, mas sim sobre:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4">
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-DDA0DD">Conhecer Você de Verdade:</span> Queremos ir além do currículo. Suas experiências, sua personalidade, como você pensa e resolve problemas são cruciais.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-DDA0DD">Avaliar seu Potencial:</span> Olhamos para sua capacidade de crescer, aprender e se adaptar aos desafios futuros da empresa.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-DDA0DD">Entender seu Alinhamento Cultural:</span> Queremos ver se seus valores e sua forma de trabalhar se encaixam com a nossa cultura.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-DDA0DD">Sua "Storytelling" (Contar sua História):</span> Você está certo! A entrevista é a sua chance de contar a sua história profissional de forma envolvente e relevante. Não é só sobre o que você fez, mas como você fez e o impacto que gerou.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    <span class="font-bold text-DDA0DD">Linguagem vs. Ideias/Storytelling:</span> Ambos são importantes, mas com pesos diferentes.
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                        <li><span class="font-bold text-FFD700">A Preparação das Ideias e o Storytelling (Contar sua História):</span> Isso é o MAIS IMPORTANTE. Saber o que você quer comunicar, quais exemplos usar (usando o método STAR!), e como conectar suas experiências à vaga é fundamental. Uma boa história, mesmo com um inglês não perfeito, pode ser muito mais impactante do que um inglês fluente sem conteúdo.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-bold text-FFD700">A Fluência e Precisão na Linguagem (Inglês):</span> É importante para a clareza. Um bom inglês ajuda a sua história a ser compreendida sem ruídos. No entanto, o foco deve ser na clareza e na comunicação eficaz, não na perfeição. Erros acontecem, mas a capacidade de expressar suas ideias de forma lógica e impactante é o que realmente conta.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="text-sm text-purple-200">
                    <strong>Conclusão:</strong> Invista tempo em estruturar suas respostas, pensar em exemplos concretos e praticar a "storytelling" das suas experiências. O inglês virá com a prática, mas a base da sua performance está no conteúdo e na sua capacidade de se conectar.

            <p class="ceo-quote">"In a globalized business world, precise English grammar is not just about correctness; it's about clarity, professionalism, and conveying your experience with impact. Mastering these tenses will significantly elevate your interview performance."</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3 class="subsection-title">Present Perfect Tense: "I have done..." (Eu tenho feito...)</h3>
                <p class="mb-2"><strong>Construction:</strong> Subject + <span class="highlight">have/has</span> + Past Participle (verbo no passado participio)</p>
                <p class="mb-4"><strong>Importance for Brazilians:</strong> Unlike Portuguese, where the simple past (e.g., "Eu fiz") is often used for recent actions or experiences, English uses the Present Perfect to connect past actions to the present. This is crucial in interviews to:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Show ongoing experience:</strong> When your past experience is still relevant or continues to impact your current skills.
                        <br><em>Ex:</em> "I <span class="highlight">have worked</span> in sales for five years." (Eu trabalho/trabalhei em vendas há cinco anos, e ainda é relevante para mim).</li>
                    <li><strong>Highlight achievements with present relevance:</strong> Actions completed in the past but whose results are visible or important now.
                        <br><em>Ex:</em> "I <span class="highlight">have successfully implemented</span> a new CRM system, which is now streamlining our client interactions." (Eu implementei com sucesso um novo sistema CRM, e os resultados são visíveis agora).</li>
                    <li><strong>Discuss experiences without a specific time:</strong> When the exact time of the action is not important, but the experience itself is.
                        <br><em>Ex:</em> "I <span class="highlight">have led</span> several cross-functional teams." (Eu já liderei várias equipes multifuncionais - a experiência é o que importa, não quando exatamente).</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-sm text-purple-200">
                    <strong>Dica para Brasileiros:</strong> No português, usamos "Eu fiz" para algo que aconteceu no passado. No inglês, se essa ação passada tem um impacto no presente ou a experiência continua, use o Present Perfect. Evite usar "I did" para descrever toda a sua experiência profissional, a menos que se refira a um evento específico e concluído no passado sem conexão com o agora.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Present Perfect Continuous Tense: "I have been doing..." (Eu tenho estado fazendo...)</h3>
                <p class="mb-2"><strong>Construction:</strong> Subject + <span class="highlight">have/has been</span> + Verb-ing (verbo com -ing)</p>
                <p class="mb-4"><strong>Importance for Brazilians:</strong> This tense emphasizes the *duration* or *ongoing nature* of an activity that started in the past and continues up to the present, or has just stopped but has a clear result in the present. It's vital for interviews to:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Describe continuous efforts/projects:</strong> When you want to show sustained involvement and dedication.
                        <br><em>Ex:</em> "I <span class="highlight">have been developing</span> this software for the past six months." (Eu estou desenvolvendo este software há seis meses, e ainda estou trabalhando nele ou acabei de terminar).</li>
                    <li><strong>Show active engagement in ongoing processes:</strong> Particularly useful for roles that involve continuous improvement, research, or long-term client relationships.
                        <br><em>Ex:</em> "I <span class="highlight">have been actively researching</span> market trends to identify new opportunities." (Eu tenho pesquisado ativamente as tendências de mercado e continuo fazendo isso).</li>
                    <li><strong>Explain a recent activity that has a present result:</strong> The action might have just finished, but its effects are current.
                        <br><em>Ex:</em> "I <span class="highlight">have been preparing</span> for this interview all week." (Eu estive me preparando para esta entrevista a semana toda, e por isso estou pronto agora).</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-sm text-purple-200">
                    <strong>Dica para Brasileiros:</strong> Pense no Present Perfect Continuous quando você usaria "Eu estou fazendo [algo] há [tempo]" ou "Eu estive fazendo [algo]". Ele reforça a ideia de continuidade e dedicação ao longo do tempo, algo muito valorizado em descrições de experiência profissional.

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Key Responsibilities Across Roles</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">While job titles vary, these are common expectations and responsibilities that span across many professional fields, combining insights from various roles like tech, marketing, project management, and more:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4">
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-DDA0DD">Problem Solving & Critical Thinking:</span> Identifying issues, analyzing root causes, and developing effective, practical solutions.
                        <br><em>Example:</em> "When our project faced an unexpected technical roadblock, I didn't just report it. I analyzed the system logs, collaborated with the engineering team to pinpoint the root cause, and proposed three viable solutions, ultimately leading to a swift resolution that kept us on schedule."</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-DDA0DD">Effective Communication:</span> Articulating ideas clearly and concisely, both verbally and in writing, to diverse audiences (colleagues, clients, leadership).
                        <br><em>Example:</em> "I regularly present complex data insights to non-technical stakeholders. For instance, I created a simplified dashboard that visualizes key metrics, enabling our sales team to quickly understand campaign performance and make informed decisions."</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-DDA0DD">Collaboration & Teamwork:</span> Working effectively with cross-functional teams, contributing positively to group dynamics, and supporting shared goals.
                        <br><em>Example:</em> "On a recent product launch, I initiated daily stand-ups with the marketing, sales, and engineering teams. This fostered open communication, ensured everyone was aligned on goals, and helped us proactively address inter-departmental dependencies, leading to a seamless launch."</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-DDA0DD">Adaptability & Agility:</span> Navigating change, embracing new technologies or methodologies, and adjusting strategies in response to evolving market conditions or project requirements.
                        <br><em>Example:</em> "When our primary market shifted due to new regulations, I quickly adapted our content strategy, researching the new landscape and pivoting our messaging to remain relevant and compliant. This allowed us to maintain our market share despite the significant change."</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-DDA0DD">Results Orientation & Accountability:</span> Focusing on delivering measurable outcomes, taking ownership of tasks, and being accountable for successes and failures.
                        <br><em>Example:</em> "I was responsible for a lead generation campaign that aimed for a 10% conversion rate. When we initially hit 7%, I took ownership, analyzed the funnel, identified areas for improvement, and implemented A/B tests that ultimately boosted our conversion to 12%."</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-DDA0DD">Continuous Learning & Self-Development:</span> Proactively seeking new knowledge, improving skills, and staying current with industry trends.
                        <br><em>Example:</em> "Recognizing the growing importance of data privacy, I proactively completed an online course on GDPR compliance and applied the principles to our internal data handling policies, strengthening our company's security posture."</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-DDA0DD">Strategic Thinking:</span> Understanding how individual tasks contribute to broader organizational goals and identifying opportunities for long-term growth and efficiency.
                        <br><em>Example:</em> "Beyond managing daily tasks, I identified that our current customer support system was inefficient for long-term growth. I researched and proposed a new CRM solution, demonstrating how it would not only improve immediate response times but also provide valuable data for future product development and customer retention."</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-DDA0DD">Time Management & Prioritization:</span> Organizing tasks, managing deadlines, and effectively allocating resources to meet objectives.
                        <br><em>Example:</em> "Facing multiple competing project deadlines, I utilized a Kanban board to visualize workflows and prioritize tasks based on business impact. This allowed my team to consistently meet critical milestones and avoid bottlenecks."</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-DDA0DD">Client/Customer Focus:</span> Understanding and addressing the needs of internal and external stakeholders to deliver exceptional service or products.
                        <br><em>Example:</em> "I initiated quarterly feedback sessions with our key clients to understand their evolving needs. This direct engagement led to the development of two new features that significantly improved client satisfaction scores and reduced churn by 15%."</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-DDA0DD">Innovation & Creativity:</span> Generating new ideas, challenging the status quo, and finding novel ways to improve processes or products.
                        <br><em>Example:</em> "Instead of relying on traditional advertising, I proposed and led a pilot program for interactive social media campaigns. This creative approach resulted in a 30% higher engagement rate and provided valuable insights into new audience segments."</li>
                </ul>
